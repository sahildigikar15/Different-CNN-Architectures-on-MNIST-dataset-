<h3>1] Kernel (5,5) performs better than other two kernels in my architecture.<br>
2] We got max Test Accuracy of 99.44 when we apply padding+batchnormalization + dropout on kernel (5,5) with 3 LSTM layers and on kernel(7,7) with 2 LSTM  layers <br>
3]Most of test Accuracy is greater than 99.30 <br></h3>
